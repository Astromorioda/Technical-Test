# Technical-Test
Solucion of technical test with python

1. Define a function max() that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the greater of the two. (It is true that Python has a built-in max() function, but creating it ourselves is a very good exercise.)

2. Define a function max_of_three() that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the greatest of them.

3. Write a function that takes a character and returns True if it is a vowel, otherwise it returns False.

4. Write a sum() function and a multip() function that respectively sum and multiply all the numbers in a list. For example, sum([1,2,3,4]) should return 10 and multip([1,2,3,4]) should return 24.

5. Define a function reverse() that calculates the reversal of a string. For example, the string "estoy probando" should return the string "odnaborp yotse".

6. Define a function is_palindrome() that recognizes palindromes (i.e. words that look the same when written backwards), for example: is_palindrome("radar") should return True.

7. Define a function overlap() that takes two lists and returns True if they have at least one common member or returns False otherwise. Write the function using a nested for loop.

8. Define a function generate_n_chars() that takes an integer n and returns the character multiplied by n. For example, generate_n_chars(5, "x") should return "xxxxx".
